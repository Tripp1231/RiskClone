      (Ordered by importance)
           TO DO BOARD
    With the changes made ot printBoard() there needs to be a max number of troops at a province
        Cannot be greater than 999 troops at a province, although rare still possible
    Figure out how to clear the console in CLion it looks terrible after a while
    Risk Card system needs implementation
    Need to implement risks attacking and defending dice rolling


             FUN IDEA BOARD
    Implementing a "fog of war"
        Making is so that only immediately/+2/+3 adjacent tiles are visible to player
            Requires unique Map vision depending on the player
            Map is going to have to be larger
    Implementing "Terrain"
        Terrain would make places uncrossable or inaccesible universally
        Could be pretty easy to implement
        Random or purposefully built?
    Reworking Risks attacking system to reward aggression
        Coin Flipping, troops are rewarded at the end of a turn not the beginning
            Fundamentally changes Risk
            WideRisk -- Risk is currently Tall
    How could an Adjacency matrix be used/is it better to use it?
    Implementing different Factions
        Child of Player.h?
