      (Ordered by importance)
           TO DO BOARD
    Fork to change what is contained within our pairs
        A Player Object should be contained in the .first so that they can be edited
        Make attacking easier, makes losing and winning more clear
    Winning/Losing/Game-ending needs to be implemented
    PrintBoard() gets ugly quick
        Fix it so it looks better line to line even if they contain varying numbers
    Figure out how to clear the console in CLion it looks terrible after a while
    Risk Card system needs implementation


             FUN IDEA BOARD
    Implementing a "fog of war"
        Making is so that only immediately/+2/+3 adjacent tiles are visible to player
            Requires unique Map vision depending on the player
            Map is going to have to be larger
    Implementing "Terrain"
        Terrain would make places uncrossable or inaccesible universally
        Could be pretty easy to implement
        Random or purposefully built?
    Reworking Risks attacking system to reward aggression
        Coin Flipping, troops are rewarded at the end of a turn not the beginning
            Fundamentally changes Risk
    How could an Adjacency matrix be used/is it better to use it?
    Implementing different Factions
        Child of Player.h?
